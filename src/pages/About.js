            This Go game I designed to help me practice Javascript, CSS, React, etc and other skills. I'm constantly iterating, and implementing
            new concepts.

            I find the web3 and decentralized tech stack to be super interesting,  and I have a particular interest in tokenomics
            and Regenerative finance. I'm interested in how we can create recursive positive externalities to create
            a better more sustainable world, and an economy that works for the people. I spend quite a bit of time
            thinking about cash-flows as primatives, and how to bridge the gap between the metaverse and
            the physical world.

            A couple of projects that I like are KlimaDAO, for carbon removal, Circles for, for UBI/local currencies and Influence, a blockchain
            native space MMO game.
